# New York City Tree Health Classification

**Author**: Benjamin Dean

# Overview

Green space is vital to the prosperity of a city and the welfare of its inhabitants. It is therefore critical that the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation utilize their resources and funding effectively and efficiently to preserve and promote the health of the city's over five million trees. A testament to their effort, the Parks department, alongside a crew of volunteers, has censused data for every public tree located alongside a New York City street. The City maintains a website called “NYC Open Data” which provides free public data published by NYC agencies and other parties.  Interested members of the public are invited to learn more about data analysis, download data sets, suggest additional areas of data collection, make comments and to ask questions. The data source for the project is the “2015 Street Tree Census - Tree Data” found on the https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Environment website. The download CSV used to populate the initial dataframe is “2015StreetTrees Census_TREES.csv.crdownload”.

# Business Problem

* Which factors are most prevalent among trees in poor health?
* Which factors most contribute to a tree's health?
Trees in poor health require additional maintenance and attention by the Parks Department. These trees may have a poor appearance, increase the risk of injury to the public through falling branches, and may require higher levels of pruning or even complete removal. Our analysis will help us to determine data values which are indicators of poor health in a tree, so that action can be taken to reduce the overall number of sick trees in the city, or to intervene before the tree’s health deteriorates.
